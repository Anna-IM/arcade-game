This game is a recreation of the classic arcade game Frogger. It is used object-oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.
The game logic and the main code is written in `app.js` file. The visual assets and the image loading utility were provided in `resources.js` and the game loop engine is in `engine.js`.

## Let's start playing:

1. The target of your player is to go to the water and to collect all the 5 _stars_. 
2. The _stars_ are the bonus for the player and multiply its score.
3. Use your keyboard arrow keys to move the player up, down, right and left.
4. Be carefull with the __bugs__, you should avoid them. If some of the __bugs__ hits you, one of your lives is lost.
5. You have totally 5 lives in a game. Watch out for the __stones__, they are obstacles for the player and send him back to the initial position.
6. If you collect all the 5 _stars_, you win.
7. If you lose your 5 lives, you lose the game.
